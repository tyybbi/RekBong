An Android app to help keep track of spotted vehicle number plates (1-999).

## Features and usage

- Press FAB (+) to add new plate
    - Insert plate letters (optional) and number
    - **Hint:** If you don't care about plate letters, hide letter part from
      settings and just tap FAB and OK to quickly add the prefilled number in
      the Add plate dialog
- Long-pressing a plate in main listview allows user to edit plate
  information (letters, number and date/time) or delete it completely
- Settings
    - Reverse spotting order, i.e. from 999 down to 1
    - Hide letter part from main view, so that only number part of the plate
      is shown
    - Hide date and time from the plates
- Option to delete database contents
- About dialog that shows percent of spotted plates and some info about app

## TODO

- Add more spotting info
- Maybe add support for multiple plate formats

## Disclaimer

The project is still very much in the early stages, so big changes and
non-functional code are expected. For now, the app supports only Finnish
registration plate format.
