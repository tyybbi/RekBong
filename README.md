An Android app to help keep track of spotted vehicle number plates (1-999).

## Features and usage

- Press FAB (+) to add new plate
    - Insert plate letters (optional) and number
- Long-pressing a plate in main listview allows user to edit or delete plate
- Settings
    - Sort spotted plates in descending (default) or ascending order
    - Hide letter part from main view, so that only number part of the plate
      is shown
    - Hide date and time from the plates
- Delete database contents
- About dialog that shows percent of spotted plates and some info about app

## TODO

- Add date editing option as well (the user could insert the actual spotting
  dates)
- Maybe add more spotting info

## Disclaimer

The project is still very much in the early stages, so big changes and
non-functional code are expected.
